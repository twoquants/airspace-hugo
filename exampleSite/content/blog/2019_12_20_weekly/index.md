Our weekly review of things that caught our attention. Some things new, some things aged. Just like a good wine. From easily digestible to the hard stuff. 

## Ap√©ritif

* Reflections on 2019 made simple: [Use the BlackRock Geopolitical Risk Index as a substitute for year-end reviews](https://mrzepczynski.blogspot.com/2019/12/use-blackrock-geopolitical-risk-index.html)
* Why Trend-following hasn't performed as expected in the last decade compared to a 140 year sample. **Hint:** it has to do with the average market moves being more muted. [You Can't Always Trend When You Want, by Babu, Hoffman, Levine, Ooi, Schroeder, and Stamelos (AQR)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3487134)

## Classic

Old but gold, [William Eckhardt: The man who launched 1,000 systems](http://m.futuresmag.com/2011/02/28/william-eckhardt-man-who-launched-1000-systems).

## Digestif

Academic paper of the week: [Financial ratios and stock returns reappraised through a topological
 data analysis lens](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10297) by Pawel Dlotko, Wanling Qiu, Simon Rudkin.

Sounds crazier than it really is. The authors demonstrate the usability of an algorithm to analyze complicated and noisy data, the so called [TDA (topological data analysis) Ball Mapper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.07410.pdf). For their application, they use a set of anomalies from the asset pricing literature and visualize the multi dimensional data into a two dimensional abstract graph to spot patterns if relationships within the data. A fun and interesting way to interpret factors. In their visual interpretation high book-to-market stocks seem to yield below average return on equity, which should sound very familiar to the current crowd of value investors.
